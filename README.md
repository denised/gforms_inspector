Gravity Forms Inspector

This is a very simple plugin you can drop into your plugin directory, or just load the php with your code. 

It creates a page called "Gravity Form Inspector" in the WP Admin Tools that will let you look at
the data content of one of your forms, or search for particular form or field settings across multiple
forms.  For example, try searching for `"cssClass"` across your forms to see where you've added CSS classes.

Current limitation: displays scalar settings only; for array-valued settings, displays only the length of the array.
